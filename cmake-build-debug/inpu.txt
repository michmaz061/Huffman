Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.

"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."

"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.

"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.

Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."

A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.

"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."

"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.

"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.

Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."

A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.

"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."

"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.

"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.

Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."

A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.

"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."

"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.

"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.

Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."

A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.

"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."

"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.

"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.

Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."

A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.

"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."

"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.

Once upon a time there was a peculiar girl called Lauren Humble. She was on the way to see her Garth Raymond, when she decided to take a short cut through The Amazon Rainforest.
It wasn't long before Lauren got lost. She looked around, but all she could see were trees. Nervously, she felt into her bag for her favourite toy, Terrance the Moose, but Terrance the Moose was nowhere to be found! Lauren began to panic. She felt sure she had packed Terrance the Moose. To make matters worse, she was starting to feel hungry.
Unexpectedly, she saw a scruffy koala dressed in a yellow t-shirt disappearing into the trees.
"How odd!" thought Lauren.
For the want of anything better to do, she decided to follow the peculiarly dressed koala. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.
Eventually, Lauren reached a clearing. She found herself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from swedes, a house made from sweets, a house made from fruit gums and a house made from lollipops.
Lauren could feel her tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease her hunger.
"Hello!" she called. "Is anybody there?"
Nobody replied.
Lauren looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.
A cackle broke through the air, giving Lauren a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Terrance the Moose!
"Terrance the Moose!" shouted Lauren. She turned to the witch. "That's my toy!"
The witch just shrugged.
"Give Terrance the Moose back!" cried Lauren.
"Not on your nelly!" said the witch.
"At least let Terrance the Moose out of that cage!"
Before she could reply, three scruffy koalas rushed in from a footpath on the other side of the clearing. Lauren recognised the one in the yellow t-shirt that she'd seen earlier. The witch seemed to recognise him too.
"Hello Big Koala," said the witch.
"Good morning." The koala noticed Terrance the Moose. "Who is this?"
"That's Terrance the Moose," explained the witch.
"Ooh! Terrance the Moose would look lovely in my house. Give it to me!" demanded the koala.
The witch shook her head. "Terrance the Moose is staying with me."
"Um... Excuse me..." Lauren interrupted. "Terrance the Moose lives with me! And not in a cage!"
Big Koala ignored her. "Is there nothing you'll trade?" he asked the witch.
The witch thought for a moment, then said, "I do like to be entertained. I'll release him to anybody who can eat a whole front door."
Big Koala looked at the house made from lollipops and said, "No problem, I could eat an entire house made from lollipops if I wanted to."
"That's nothing," said the next koala. "I could eat two houses."
"There's no need to show off," said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Terrance the Moose."
Lauren watched, feeling very worried. She didn't want the witch to give Terrance the Moose to Big Koala. She didn't think Terrance the Moose would like living with a scruffy koala, away from her house and all her other toys.
The other two koalas watched while Big Koala put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Big Koala. "Just you watch!"
Big Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from sweets. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
Eventually, Big Koala started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of sweets, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.
"Erm... I don't feel too good," said Big Koala.
Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!
"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.

"Help!" he cried, as he rolled off down a slope into the forest.
Big Koala never finished eating the front door made from sweets and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Average Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from fruit gums.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Average Koala. "Just you watch!"
Average Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from fruit gums. She gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After a while, Average Koala started to look a little queasy. She grew greener...
...and greener.
A woodcutter walked into the clearing. "What's this bush doing here?" he asked.
"I'm not a bush, I'm a koala!" said Average Koala.
"It talks!" exclaimed the woodcutter. "Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt."
"No! Wait!" cried Average Koala, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the koala away under his arm.
Average Koala never finished eating the front door made from fruit gums and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
Little Koala stepped up, and approached the house made from lollipops.
"I'll eat this whole house," said Little Koala. "Just you watch!"
Little Koala pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.
And more.
And more.
After five or six platefuls, Little Koala started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.
He stopped eating lollipops for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.
But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Koala into the sky.
"Aggghhhhhh!" cried Little Koala. "I'm scared of heigh..."
Little Koala was never seen again.
Little Koala never finished eating the front door made from lollipops and Terrance the Moose remained trapped in the witch's cage.
"That's it," said the witch. "I win. I get to keep Terrance the Moose."
"Not so fast," said Lauren. "There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from swedes. And I haven't had a turn yet.
"I don't have to give you a turn!" laughed the witch. "My game. My rules."
The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. "I think you should give her a chance. It's only fair."
"Fine," said the witch. "But you saw what happened to the koalas. She won't last long."
"I'll be right back," said Lauren.
"What?" said the witch. "Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Terrance the Moose back."
Lauren ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. She came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, she broke off a piece of the door of the house made from swedes and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, she took a bite. She quickly devoured the whole piece.
Lauren sat down on a nearby log.
"You fail!" cackled the witch. "You were supposed to eat the whole door."
"I haven't finished," explained Lauren. "I am just waiting for my food to go down."
When Lauren's food had digested, she broke off another piece of the door made from swedes. Once more, she toasted her food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. She ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.
Eventually, after several sittings, Lauren was down to the final piece of the door made from swedes. Carefully, she toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. She finished her final course. Lauren had eaten the entire front door of the house made from swedes.
The witch stamped her foot angrily. "You must have tricked me!" she said. "I don't reward cheating!"
"I don't think so!" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. "This little girl won fair and square. Now hand over Terrance the Moose or I will chop your broomstick in half."
The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.
Lauren hurried over and grabbed Terrance the Moose, checking that her favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Terrance the Moose was unharmed.
Lauren thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Garth. It was starting to get dark.
When Lauren got to Garth's house, her threw his arms around her.
"I was so worried!" cried Garth. "You are very late."
As Lauren described her day, she could tell that Garth didn't believe her. So she grabbed a napkin from her pocket.
"What's that?" asked Garth.
Lauren unwrapped a doorknob made from sweets. "Pudding!" she said.
Garth almost fell off his chair.
